We're only providing support to developers/collaborators at the moment. In other words: if you've built Lona Studio in Xcode or attempted to generate code, feel free to report issues or ask for help. Otherwise, please wait for our official release -- we'll provide more designer-facing instructions and documentation as we get closer.
