This directory contains the apps used for running Lona's test components.

### iOS

The iOS project can run visual UI tests using applitools. You'll need to make a file `iOSUITests/test.env` containing your (free) applitools API key:

```
APPLITOOLS_API_KEY=...
```

### Web

The web project can also run visual UI tests, and you can use the same API key. More details here: https://github.com/airbnb/Lona/pull/357
